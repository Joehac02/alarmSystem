# alarmSystem
## An Engineering Problem

A security system is needed to protect the Hope Diamond housed in the Natural History Museum.  The room has 1 door and 2 windows that need to be outfitted with sensors.  When the system is armed by pressing a button, the user has 10 seconds to vacate the room before the alarm arms.  Once armed, if a door or window is opened, the alarm will sound 5 seconds later UNLESS the “all clear” button is pressed.  If the alarm sounds, a code must be entered to clear the alarm.
